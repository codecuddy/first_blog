				<h3>January 9, 2015</h3>
					<p>My name is Charlie Cuddy. I'm currently in my fifth year teaching high school math, mainly second year algebra. I also am the head cross country and head track coach for our boys and girls varsity teams. </p>
					<p>I've been using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy</a> to learn how to write code for several weeks now. I started with the javascript tutorial. There were some pros and some cons to starting in javascript in my opinion. It was way more challenging than html and css and I can see how one might easily get discouraged and want to give up. However, I liked that the projects we built were more interactive which made it more likely that I'd come back and work on the projects. </p>
					<p>I've found that using html and css seems to make way more sense. I'm not sure if it is because of the background I had from the tutorials in javascript, or if it is because it really is that much easier. It has been nice that I've recognized some key words and phrases that show up in both. I am looking forward to learning more, and I have even signed up to take an html/css class at my local library next month.</p>
					<p> One of my first projects that I carried over from Khan Academy was a basic web page that taught me how to place photos on the webpage while planning <a target="_blank" href="file:///D:/Coding/Notepad++%20Ideas/Perfect%20Trip_Khan.html">the perfect trip.</a></p>

					<h3>January 13, 2015</h3>
						<p> I just downloaded notepad++ today and am playing around with it for the first time. I've watched a few youtube videos to gain some pointers. The biggest help those provided was showing me which plugins were helpful to add right off the start. It is nice coming over from Khan Academy where it was expected to memorize a lot and knowing that when I'm using notepad++ that the program really helps you remember. I'm looking forward to playing around and really getting my hands dirty with it. '</p>
						<p> Another very helpful tool that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy </a> showed me yesterday or today was how to use <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/"> validator.w3.org</a> to validate if my html is ready to roll. I think I'll really learn a lot from having my errors pointed out to me. I am a bit of a perfectionist and look forward to the challenge of correcting my errors so as to avoid them in the future.  </p>
						<p> My cousin, Patrick, started taking a few courses at UNL this week in computer programming. I hope to be in constant talks with him to see what he is learning and what I can apply. I want to look more into java eclipse and what it offers. </p>

					<h3>February 24, 2015</h3>
						<p> I'm starting to understand enough of html that I'm not looking up every tag and trying to remember the difference between an id and a class. I also used a div to center my table of contents list which was pretty sweet. I've still only got a rough idea of what that is for, but it seems like it works like a class, but for more lines of code.</p>
						<p> I also started adding different color colors to the hyperlinks with a style sheet.</p>
					<h3> February 26, 2015</h3>
						<p> It has been a lot of fun to start to think of ways that I could potentially fix "problems" that I'm having and then try them out instead of looking up every thing. I was able to take what I had learned from organizing pictures on Katie Mac's page and apply them to my text and create columns.</p>
						<p> I was really excited to learn to access photos from my computer instead of only being able to pull photos from links to the pictures that are online.</p>

					<h3> April 26, 2015</h3>
						<p> It has been awhile since I updated this blog because I've been working on finishing HTML and CSS classes through <a target ="_blank" href="www.codecademy.com"> Codecademy</a>. I feel way more confident those two languages.</p>
						<p> I can tell I still need more work on setting the margins, border and padding. </p>
						<p> I am going to try and get back up and rolling on <a target="_blank" href="file:///D:/Coding/Notepad++%20Ideas/Katie%20Mac%20Photography/KMacPhotography.html"> Katie Mac's Photography</a> website and see how that goes.</p>

					<h3>January 10, 2015</h3>
						<p>As I've worked on my coding over the past few weeks, I've been trying to play out ideas that I would like to try and build. I know I don't have the background to do them all yet, but it is my hope that I can work towards these projects in the near future.</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>A web page for the classes I teach with video of the lessons. Students could then stay caught up when they are gone by watching lecture. Pdf of notes.</li>
								<li>Fantasy football, league vs league.</li>
								<li>Hudl type program, but more running based. Log miles, workouts, shoes, pace, etc.</li>
							</ul>
